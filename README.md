# hello-world
I'm 44 and a big believer in living all your dreams--life is too short. I love animals, nature, hiking, kayaking, camping, gardening, painting, and traveling.  I currently work in logistics. 
I currently have 1 dog and 2 cats. Hoping to add chickens for 2024, and maybe beehives in 2025. 
I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan but sadly, I haven't been able to watch a game in years.
